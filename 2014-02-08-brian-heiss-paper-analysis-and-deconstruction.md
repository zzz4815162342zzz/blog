# Brian Heiss paper: analysis and deconstruction
A paper has been spread recently that tries to analyze situation with LGBT rights in Russia and its coverage by US media and politicians. Although it makes certain very good points, I feel like it goes to another extreme and presents an
excessively placid picture. The purpose of this short essay is to respond from the perspective of a Russian citizen to
some of the theses that the paper and its followers propose.

## Paper breakdown
The paper consists of a preface, an executive summary, 6 chapters, an afterword and an appendix containing the full text of relevant federal laws in Russia. Executive summary contains 10 main points, some of which I address in the following section of this essay. Chapters 1, 4, 5 and 6 concern United States legislation and media. While interesting and thought-provoking, they are clearly irrelevant to the topic of the paper (titled *Russian Federation Anti-Gay Laws: An Analysis & Deconstruction*). Nevertheless, some particular items are also addressed in the following section.

Chapter 2 discusses the text of the infamous 'gay propaganda' law. While the analysis is fair and thorough, the author fails to take two things into account:
- The context under which the law was prepared. In particular, previous versions of the law and personalities and views of its main ideologists (Elena Mizulina and Vitaly Milonov).
- Peculiarity of modern Russian judicial system: it's not the letter of the law that matters, it's how, by whom and against whom it's used.

I can't stress this second point enough. There is a Russian saying: 'The strictness of laws is compensated by optionality of following them'. As we'll see, this can work the other way around.

Chapter 3 reviews prosecutions and convictions made according to this and similar laws in Russia in 2006-2013 years. It concludes that only 6 prosecutions and 2 convictions took place. While the numbers are incorrect, we will see that they have a grain of truth. Concluding thesis of the chapter, that *announcement* of Russian officials that they are *willing* to take all necessary measures to prevent homophobic crimes, is somehow a 'key development', particularly raises eyebrows and poses a question of author's bias.

## Rebuttal of main points
This section of the essay aims to dispell some misinformed statements that Heiss' paper and its followers make.

* The law never mentions or uses the word gay, lesbian, homosexual or any other LGBT identifier.  
The first edition of the law contained the word 'homosexual', and it's clearly directed at LGBT community as openly homophobic authors of the law confirmed in multiple interviews.

* Only propaganda to children is banned.  
Any public place may potentially have children, so any public pro-LGBT action is banned. You are allowed to run a gay pride in your house or in a gay club, for instance.

* Russia is actually expanding protections of members of the LGBT community.  
No action whatsoever has been taken in this direction. On the contrary, the hate towards LGBT people is supported and encouraged by the government. Some examples:
  - Dmitry Kiselev, a journalist who announced at prime time at the main Russian TV channel that 'gays' hearts must be burned', was promoted to general manager of *Russia Today* informational agency (a subsidiary of which is the well-known RT channel.)
  - Ivan Okhlobystin, an actor and former orthodox priest, who announced that 'gays must be burned alive in ovens' hasn't been charged with hate speech crime. The maximum penalty that awaits him is a $1000 fine.
  - Lena Klimova, the creator of a support group 'Children-404' for LGBT teenagers in a Russian social network is being accused of 'gay propaganda' and the group might be closed. This is particularly ironic, since the law supposedly seeks to 'protect the children'.

* Almost no one was convicted according to this law.  
This is technically correct. If you try to conduct any public pro-LGBT action (even a single-person picket with a rainbow flag), you will be arrested immediately, detained in police station for a couple of hours, a police protocol will be composed and you will be set free without any charges. This is a common tactic against all protestors in Russia, whatever their message is.

* You cannot be fired from your job for being an LGBT individual in Russia.  
Of course, no law allows this. But it doesn't stop alert citizens.
  - A gay teacher from Khabarovsk Alexander Ermoshkin had to resign after a homophobic campaign against him. Soon after, his contract with a university wasn't prolongated either. The editor of a local newspaper who published an article about this case was fined with $1500 for 'gay propaganda'.
  - A (heterosexual) Moscow teacher Ilya Kolmanovsky was fired for taking part in pro-LGBT actions. After a backlash he was employed back.

## Conclusion
The author of the paper in question did a decent job given the sources he had available. We cannot blame him for his lack of hands-on experience and cultural context. But for the sake of justice some comments have to be made:
* The *formulation* of the law is clearly discriminatory since it implies that members of LGBT community are not socially equal to the rest of society.
* The *law enforcement practices* didn't change much. It was *de facto* illegal to hold a gay pride in Moscow before the law was passed just like it is now. It's *not* illegal to be gay; essentially it's a *Don't ask, don't (publically) tell*
policy.
* The *social effect* of the law has been catastrophic. Recognition of LGBT community as second class citizens on a federal level led to skyrocketing amount of hate speech, bullying and physical abuse. People from conservative majority
feel like they have been given a *carte blanche* for anything: from detaining young women for holding hands to outing and beating gay teenagers. Changing the public opinion is impossible, because trying to do so would qualify as 'gay
propaganda'. And although the law itself may be repealed, the harm that it has caused cannot be undone in the near future.
